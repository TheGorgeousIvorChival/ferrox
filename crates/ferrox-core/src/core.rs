//! The pinned upstream implementation, and what it actually compiles to.
//!
//! This module is deliberately small. The keystream itself lives in the
//! crate-private `chacha` module; what remains here is the thing the keystream
//! is *checked against*, and the honest name of the backend that check runs on.
//!
//! Both are compiled out of every shipped build, behind `cfg(test)` or the
//! `bench-reference` feature. If the shipped path could reach the reference,
//! then "bit-identical" would be a claim about comparing the reference against
//! itself.
//!
//! The cipher traits are imported inside `reference_xor` rather than at module
//! scope for the same reason: a module-scope import would warn in exactly the
//! builds that must stay warning-free.

/// The reference: the `chacha20` crate, used only by tests and benchmarks.

/// Its `backends.rs` only selects NEON when a `chacha20_force_neon` cfg is set,
/// and nothing in the crate sets it, so on aarch64 it silently runs the scalar
/// `soft` backend at one block per iteration. A benchmark that compared against
/// "chacha20 0.9.1" without saying so would credit that gap to this workspace's
/// own work. So the name is reported, not inferred.
///
/// The x86 answer is a runtime CPUID check, which is the same source of truth
/// the reference itself uses (`cpufeatures::new!(avx2_cpuid, "avx2")`).
