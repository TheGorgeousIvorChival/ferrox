//! Sixteen blocks in one pass: a state word per register, and thirty-two of them.
//!
//! `avx2` holds its sixteen registers because that is the whole of the file it
//! has, and a quarter round there costs sixteen operations: rotating by twelve
//! and by seven is not a byte move, so each of those is a shift, a shift and an
//! or. `avx512f` has thirty-two registers and `vprold`, which makes all four
//! rotations one operation each and leaves the sixteen live state words room for
//! the temporaries they need — and its lanes are twice as wide, so a register
//! set holds sixteen blocks against eight. The transpose is the one other place
//! the width pays: four gathers a block against the six the AVX2 pass's four
//! four-register transposes spend, for twice the blocks.
//!
//! The body is written once, over `Wide16`, and instantiated twice. `Z16`, in
//! `chacha::avx512`, is the one that ships. `P16` — safe Rust over sixteen
//! `u32` — is the one every machine in this tree can execute, and it is here
//! because AVX-512 cannot be emulated where it cannot be executed: the
//! differential test instantiates this *same* body over `P16`, so the pass's
//! counter lanes, its diagonal-by-renaming, its transpose and its head are
//! checked on `aarch64` and everywhere else, and only the one instruction that
//! applies the index network is left to the runners that have it.
//!
//! The transpose is index data rather than a hand-written unpack network. Four
//! stages, each swapping bit `k` of the register name with bit `k` of the lane,
//! turn `word w of block b` into `block b's word w`; a stage needs two index
//! vectors, one for the registers whose own bit `k` is clear and one for the
//! registers whose bit `k` is set, and every pair of registers in the stage
//! shares them. Sixty-four gathers for sixteen blocks, four a block, against the
//! forty-eight the AVX2 pass spends on its eight: the narrower pass pays six a
//! block for the same permutation.
