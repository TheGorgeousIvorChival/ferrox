//! The gate `ci.yml` runs: everything that can be wrong with the library
//! without rendering it.
//!
//! # Why a gate at all
//!
//! The library is Markdown, which means it can be edited in an editor that has
//! never heard of this grammar. Every check here is a mistake that has actually
//! been made in one of the two projects this replaces, or that would be easy to
//! make in the next one:
//!
//! - a `**Touches:**` path that no longer exists, so the roadmap points at a
//!   file that was deleted or renamed;
//! - a `+path` that already exists, so the prompt describes creating a file that
//!   is already there — which is either work that is done and still listed, or a
//!   slice filed against the wrong place;
//! - two open prompts claiming one file, which cannot both be true of a
//!   contributor working alone;
//! - a gate naming a workflow file that has been renamed;
//! - a gate that is a command written without backticks, so a reader cannot tell
//!   it is one;
//! - a placeholder whose default is empty, which renders as a hole that looks
//!   like a value.
//!
//! # What it does not check
//!
//! Whether a prompt is a good prompt. That is the one judgement in this file that
//! only a person can make, and a CI job that grades prose gets deleted the first
//! time it is wrong.
