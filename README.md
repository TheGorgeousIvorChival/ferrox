# Ferrox

FERROX — Fast Efficient Relay Router Overlay X. *ferro*, iron, for Rust; *X*, for Xray.

A from-scratch proxy core, built to be **bit-identical to the implementations it replaces** and **verifiably not slower than any of them**.

## Goals

1. **Prove everything shipped is faster and leaner.** Bit-identical output, fewer operations, zero surviving copies, no allocation. Counts prove, durations suggest: instruction counts are gated exact, so a diff that removes one operation changes a number every runner reproduces.
2. **Be a drop-in replacement for Xray-core.** Not "implement its protocols" — run its pinned test suites unmodified against a Ferrox binary in CI, plus every suite with a seam to inject it through.
3. **Be a drop-in replacement for zeptun**, the `tun2socks` engine: TUN to TCP/UDP/ICMP through a SOCKS5 or direct handler, `userspace` / `hybrid` / `system` stacks.
4. **Be feature-complete in what quiche, slipstream and aether are ahead on.** QUIC and MASQUE, DNS-tunnel carriers, nested tunnels, multi-path schedulers, domain fronting. Libraries and product surfaces, read for the technique and implemented on Ferrox's terms.
5. **Spoof SNI without root.** DPI circumvention by injecting a fake TLS ClientHello with an allowlisted SNI ahead of the real handshake. `VpnService` TUN plus a userspace TCP stack does it in user space. Nothing in CI checks this yet.

## How it is built

- **One algorithm, four widths.** The record layer is one generic function over a `Lanes` trait — portable arrays, NEON, SSE2, AVX2 — so backends execute the *same source* and cannot disagree. The portable path is safe Rust, so Miri interprets the ladder and the SIMD modules stay five instructions each whose only failure mode is a wrong answer.
- **Rewrite, not port.** The minimal subset covering the matrix, proven faster down to the parsing. One line of comment per item at most, no changelogs — checked by `scripts/check-comments.sh`. The shared protocol is `crates/ferrox-prompt/prompts.md`.
- **Counts prove, durations suggest.** Instruction counts are gated exact; allocation counts, copy counts and syscall counts are gated exactly too, and each method page names the checker for every number it states. A count nobody has measured is written `UNBLESSED`, which is a claim that is open, not a number.
- **One TLS stack, one interface.** `TlsProvider` is implemented by rustls, and the provider *is* `Read + Write`, so nothing above can depend on the stack underneath. No feature to select, no build without TLS.
- **quiche is the default QUIC, not a preference.** Whenever a rung needs QUIC and quiche is feasible, quiche; anything else must name the rung, the library, and the measurement that won.
- **The reference is not as fast as it looks.** Comparators often ship SIMD behind a cfg nothing sets, so part of any speedup is the baseline not using its path. Every report prints both backends in the header; a ratio quoted without both names is not a measurement.
- **Lints and operation counts are local; nothing connection-dependent is.** `./scripts/check.sh` before every push: fmt, clippy, docs, the policy checks, the exact instruction counts against `scripts/expected-ops.txt`, the prompt library, the tests. What needs a connection is CI-only — every developer machine is behind a VPN and a proxy, so a local benchmark measures a tunnel and a local conformance run measures somebody's exit node.
- **Nothing runs on a merge.** A merge cannot break what a pull request did not already prove, so every gate fires on the PR and `main` is covered by schedules: benches daily (one hour apart, so they never read each other's load as a regression), Miri weekly across six runners, pins and the dependency graph only when their inputs change.

## What is checked

| claim | checked by |
| --- | --- |
| compiles | `ci.yml`: `cargo test --workspace` on linux x86_64, macos aarch64, windows x86_64; clippy clean |
| bit-identical output | differential test against the pinned reference, run *before* any timing |
| no use-after-free, no leak | Miri nightly for safe-Rust paths; differential tests for SIMD |
| no allocation, no zero-fill | counting global allocator, gated at exactly 0 |
| no work generated and discarded | the ladder returns its blocks; gate 2 compares against `ceil(len / 64)` at every length and offset |
| no operation added or removed | exact instruction counts, `scripts/count-ops.sh` against `scripts/expected-ops.txt` — same number on every machine, so this one runs before the push |
| not slower at any measured length ≥ 65 B | benchmark gate; 1–64 B are a tie by construction, identity-checked only. One regressing length fails the job, after a re-measure |
| upstream conformance | pinned upstream suites run unmodified against `ferrox-app` |
| parsers never panic on untrusted bytes | seeded cases over every untrusted entry point, printed on failure so a red run replays anywhere |
| dependency licence and provenance | `deny.toml` + `scripts/check-dependency-policy.sh`; GPL/AGPL comparators are refused as dependencies |
| roadmap coherence | `ferrox-prompt check`: no duplicate id, no gate-less slice, no cycle, no renamed `**Touches:**` path |
| every method page's counts match one manifest | `scripts/check-method-docs.sh` against `scripts/method-counts.txt` — a number edited in a page without editing the manifest fails, and a manifest row with no page fails |

Not claimed: that this is the fastest implementation. A benchmark measures a configuration at a point in time and decays. What is built instead is the machinery that notices.

```bash
./scripts/check.sh    # fmt, clippy, docs, policy checks, operation counts, prompt library, tests
```

That is what `ci.yml` runs. Running it first is how a lint stops costing a queue.

## Method pages

Every connection method this tree implements has a page under
[`docs/function/`](docs/function). Each one carries the same four numbers —
**ops** (retired instructions), **syscalls**, **memory copies**, and **time** —
each with the name of the checker that produces it, a `graph TD` of the data
path, and what was removed against Xray-core, sing-box and ZeroNet.

Every number in those tables is a row in
[`scripts/method-counts.txt`](scripts/method-counts.txt), and
`scripts/check-method-docs.sh` fails if a page and that file disagree. That is
the whole mechanism: a count that is not in the manifest is not a claim, and a
claim with no checker is not made.

| method | page | syscalls | copies per byte | ops | time |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| record layer (ChaCha20) | [record-layer](docs/function/record-layer.md) | 0 | 0 (in place) | `UNBLESSED` | not measured |
| Shadowsocks AEAD | [shadowsocks](docs/function/shadowsocks.md) | **1 write per 16 KiB read**, 2 reads per chunk | 1 written, **0** read | `UNBLESSED` | not measured |
| VMess AEAD | [vmess](docs/function/vmess.md) | **1 write per 32 KiB read** (4 frames) | 1 written, **0** read | `UNBLESSED` | not measured |
| VLESS TCP | [vless](docs/function/vless.md) | 1 write per header, 0 framing after | 1 (the relay's own) | `UNBLESSED` | not measured |
| Trojan TCP | [trojan](docs/function/trojan.md) | 1 write per header, 0 framing after | 1 (the relay's own) | `UNBLESSED` | not measured |
| XTLS Vision | [xtls-vision](docs/function/xtls-vision.md) | 0 framing after the switch | **2** framed, **0** after the switch | `UNBLESSED` | not measured |
| Mux.Cool + XUDP | [mux-cool](docs/function/mux-cool.md) | 1 write per frame | **0** written, 1 read | `UNBLESSED` | not measured |
| WebSocket | [carrier-websocket](docs/function/carrier-websocket.md) | **1 read per 32 KiB window** (64 frames), 1 write per frame | 0 unmasked write, 1 masked | `UNBLESSED` | not measured |
| HTTPUpgrade | [carrier-httpupgrade](docs/function/carrier-httpupgrade.md) | 1 read, 1 write | 1 (the relay's own) | `UNBLESSED` | not measured |
| HTTP masquerade | [carrier-httpheader](docs/function/carrier-httpheader.md) | 1 read, 1 write | 1 (the relay's own) | `UNBLESSED` | not measured |
| gRPC | [carrier-grpc](docs/function/carrier-grpc.md) | 1 write per message | 1 written, 1 read | `UNBLESSED` | not measured |
| xHTTP | [carrier-xhttp](docs/function/carrier-xhttp.md) | 1 write per chunk, **2 reads per 16 KiB chunk** | 1 written | `UNBLESSED` | not measured |
| QUIC | [carrier-quic](docs/function/carrier-quic.md) | 1 handshake per server | quiche's | `UNBLESSED` | not measured |
| Foxy lane (h1/h2/h3 + CONNECT-UDP) | [carrier-foxy](docs/function/carrier-foxy.md) | 1 write per DATA frame, **1 DATA frame per datagram** | **0** staged either way, 1 in the record | `UNBLESSED` | not measured |
| Hysteria v2 | [carrier-hysteria](docs/function/carrier-hysteria.md) | 1 handshake per flow | 1 backlog plus the relay's own | `UNBLESSED` | not measured |
| REALITY / TLS | [reality-tls](docs/function/reality-tls.md) | per handshake, rustls | per handshake, rustls | `UNBLESSED` | not measured |
| KCP | [kcp](docs/function/kcp.md) | 1 sendto per segment | in place, **1 send buffer for the whole window, pooled receive buffers** (was one per 1 332 B each way) | `UNBLESSED` | not measured |

Two columns read "not measured" on every row, and that is the honest state
rather than a gap in the table:

- **ops.** `scripts/expected-ops.txt` still blesses exactly one symbol in the
  whole tree, `der_to_pem 2653`, and it is a PEM formatting helper rather than a
  carrier. `scripts/method-ops.txt` is the open list: `ops.yml` measures every
  symbol on it on every run and publishes the numbers as the `method-ops`
  artefact, which is what turns a row from `UNBLESSED` into a number somebody
  can read and decide to bless. Blessing one means reading the diff that moved
  it, never copying a measurement to silence the gate.
- **time.** Every duration in this repository comes from a named runner:
  `bench.yml`, `parity.yml`, `compare.yml`, `speedtest.yml` and
  `benchmark-matrix.yml`. A number produced off a laptop behind a VPN is a
  measurement of the tunnel, so no page quotes one that no CI artefact has
  produced. The gates that *are* deterministic — allocation counts, copy counts,
  syscall counts — are gated, and those are the numbers the pages lead with.

### What the last branch removed, in counts

Two of these are gated by a counter; the rest are argued from the source at the
line named, and the page says which is which. A number nobody can produce is not
a number, so only the first table below appears in `scripts/method-counts.txt`.

| rung | removed | gate |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [shadowsocks](docs/function/shadowsocks.md) | two of the three passes over every UDP payload, and the per-datagram allocation | `udp-payload-buffers-per-datagram 1` and `udp-datagram-reallocations-after-the-first 0`, both by pointer identity over eight datagrams |
| [kcp](docs/function/kcp.md) | a `Vec<Segment>` allocated and freed per received datagram | `segment-list-vectors-per-datagram 1`, by capacity identity over eight datagrams |
| [kcp](docs/function/kcp.md) | `n - 1` of every `n` reader wakeups on a multi-segment datagram | `reader-wakeups-per-datagram 1`, by the `Notifier` generation-counter delta |
| [record layer](docs/function/record-layer.md) | the 64-byte staging buffer every ChaCha open carried, its zero-fill, the scalar XOR loop, and the split that fed a third pass | argued; proved bit-identical by a 6 000-case differential against the pinned crate |
| [record layer](docs/function/record-layer.md) | the second `update` (and its dynamically sized `memcpy`) that pads an AEAD section, and the empty `absorb` at both ends of a record | argued, same differential |
| [mux-cool](docs/function/mux-cool.md) | a full `memcpy` of every inbound byte, on all three read loops | argued; `mux::decode` was already handing out a borrowed subslice |
| [shadowsocks](docs/function/shadowsocks.md) | a 16-byte tag copy per chunk, and a second 16 KiB buffer alive for the connection's whole life | argued |
| [kcp](docs/function/kcp.md) | a `Vec<Vec<u8>>` per `read`, and a second deadline lock per wait | argued |
| [carrier-websocket](docs/function/carrier-websocket.md) | an unbounded `realloc` chain in the read-ahead buffer | argued |
| [carrier-xhttp](docs/function/carrier-xhttp.md) | a framing read syscall per chunk, and a second one that moved two bytes | `read-syscalls-per-16KiB-chunk 2`, by the reader's own read counter; **measured 33 reads for 16 chunks against 49** |
| [mux-cool](docs/function/mux-cool.md) | a `memcpy` of every relayed byte on the uplink, plus a full header rebuild per read | `relay-copies-per-byte-written 0`, by the `writev` part's base address being the read buffer |
| [mux-cool](docs/function/mux-cool.md) | the same `memcpy` on the server relay's TCP task and UDP reader | same row, same gate — both paths now share the header-plus-`writev` helper, and the `CHUNK_MAX` bound moved with the encoder |
| [mux-cool](docs/function/mux-cool.md) | nothing removed — two copy rows *corrected*, one of which named a gate that counts allocations | `codec-copies-per-byte-written 1` replaces a `0` that was never observed |
| [kcp](docs/function/kcp.md) | a `malloc`/`free` per 1 332 bytes sent — about **9 400 pairs a second per direction** at 100 Mbps | `send-payload-buffers-per-window 1` and `send-payload-reallocations-per-window 0`, by arena capacity over 64 rounds |
| [kcp](docs/function/kcp.md) | a `malloc`/`free` per 1 332 bytes received — the same **9 400 pairs a second** | `receive-payload-reallocations-per-window 0`, by spare capacity over 64 rounds, and `receive-parse-allocations-per-segment 0`, by the parsed payload's base address being the lent buffer's |
| [kcp](docs/function/kcp.md) | an 18-byte header staging array and three per-segment stores, per segment | `segment-header-staging-copies-per-segment 0` |
| [vmess](docs/function/vmess.md) | a silent truncation of any relay read wider than one batch | argued; `stage_frames` now refuses, and nothing reaches the wire when it does |
| [xtls-vision](docs/function/xtls-vision.md) | nothing removed — a row *renamed* because its gate did not cover the page's subject | `seal-open-staging-allocations 0` now names `vless::VisionSeal`, not `vision::Link` |

Three of those need their limits stated, because a page that lists only wins is
not evidence:

- **The open path is now two keystream passes, not one.** MAC-before-decrypt is
  not free: Poly1305 needs no keystream, so the tag is checked first and block
  one onward is xored in afterwards. The old shape fused the one-time key and
  the first body block into one ladder pass but needed a staging buffer and a
  third pass over the tail. The block count is `1 + ceil(len/64)` before and
  after and so is the panic threshold; what changed is the staging, the scalar
  loop and the passes over the buffer. This is the order `aesgcm::open_impl` in
  this tree has always used, so the AEADs no longer disagree about when plaintext
  exists.
- **Two optimisations were measured as regressions and reverted, and the
  arithmetic is on the page.** Widening the websocket mask stride to 64 bytes
  makes the *scalar remainder* up to 63 bytes instead of under 16, so every
  length that is not a multiple of 64 gets worse. Pulling KCP segments out of
  the window one at a time instead of draining it lets `next_number` lag behind
  what one `read` consumed, and `process_segment` refuses anything
  `window_size` ahead of `next_number` — at the default 776-segment window a
  sender legitimately in flight starts having segments dropped. Both passed the
  test suite. Neither is here.
- **A copy claim needs pointer identity, because a byte test cannot see it.**
  The mux uplink used to `memcpy` every relayed byte into the frame buffer. The
  framing test passes with the copy and without it — the bytes are identical —
  so the only test that can witness the removal is one that asserts the `writev`
  part's base address *is* the read buffer. Two of this repository's copy rows
  named `ferrox-bench-gate-6`, which counts allocations and zero-fills, not
  copies, and one of them claimed `0` where the value is `1`; both are corrected.
- **Three rows on this list were previously claims with no checker behind them,
  and the honest fix was the gate, not the number.** `vmess
  frames-per-write-syscall 4` and `write-syscalls-per-32KiB-relay-read 1` were
  swept by a test whose longest payload produced *three* frames, writing into a
  `Vec` that cannot count syscalls. `xtls-vision staging-allocations-per-padded-buffer
  0` named `ferrox-bench-gate-2`, which drives the stateless `vless::VisionSeal`
  pair, not the `vision::Link` this page documents — so it is renamed
  `seal-open-staging-allocations` and the page says plainly that `Link` is under
  no allocation gate. `carrier-xhttp` had no read-syscall row at all, which is
  why the 3→2 change could not be claimed; `Reader` is now generic over `Read`
  and counts its own reads, and the row exists.
- **The send arena's own gate found a leak, which is the argument for having
  one.** `trim()` returned early when `base == 0` — the state of a window
  acknowledged down to empty between bursts — so the reclaim-everything branch
  was unreachable and the arena reached 681 984 bytes for 8 live 1 332-byte
  segments. Capacity is the witness for "one buffer, reused", and it is the same
  witness that caught the leak.
- **NOT removed:** KCP still sends one datagram per 1 332-byte segment, because
  batching would change the bytes on the wire. The mux uplink still copies every
  payload byte once, because removing that copy means splitting
  `mux::Outgoing::encode_into` in two. Both are named on their pages as open, not
  claimed as wins.

## Connection methods

The goal is a drop-in replacement for xray-core — the same JSON, the same share links, every protocol, transport and security it dials or serves — and then a superset of it: everything sing-box, ZeroNet and LxBox carry that Xray does not. Tables A–I are the verdict so far; tables J–L are the rest of that superset, read off the four pinned trees, each row naming the paths that prove the reference has it.

**Every method in table A parses.** A row is only as good as what a binary does with it, and there are two separate answers, so the table carries both:

| column | meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `link` | what `VlessLink::support()` reports — `Implemented`, `Planned { reason }` or `UnsafeRequiresOptIn { reason }` (`crates/ferrox-core/src/transport.rs:301`). This is a verdict about the *shape of the link*, computed offline. |
| `binary` | what `ferrox-app` actually dials or serves from a config — the only axis a connection ever exercises. |

They are not the same, and where they differ the table says so. `Support::Planned` exists because a cell that says why is evidence and a blank cell is not, so nothing here is silently dropped: a refusal always carries its reason string, which is the whole reason the refusal is worth reading.

`ferrox-app run <vless://…>` is deliberately *not* a dialler: it refuses unless the link is `Implemented`, then opens one TCP connection, reports the time and sends nothing. Real traffic goes through `run -c config.json`, which binds inbounds (`vless`, `trojan`, `vmess`, `shadowsocks`, `socks`, `http`, `mixed`) and needs a `freedom` outbound. `check <vless://…>` is fully offline.

### A — proxy protocols (the share-link world)

Every implemented row links to its page: the counts, the data-path graph, and
what was removed against the pinned implementations live there, not here.
This table is the verdict; the page is the evidence. Rows 1–22 are the share-link world; rows 23–39 are the xray-core config surface the tree must also read — same columns, same honesty.

| # | method | link | binary | page | notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | VLESS TCP REALITY `xtls-rprx-vision` | `vless-tcp-reality-vision` | **server only** | [vless](docs/function/vless.md) · [xtls-vision](docs/function/xtls-vision.md) · [reality-tls](docs/function/reality-tls.md) | Server role is complete: `shortId`/`X25519` auth (`crates/ferrox-core/src/tls/reality.rs`), Vision framing (`crates/ferrox-app/src/vision.rs`), over raw + gRPC + ws + xhttp + httpUpgrade + http header. An unauthenticated hello is spliced to `dest` with an optional PROXY header and rate limit, dialled lazily so an authenticated hello costs the cover origin nothing. The **client is not wired**: an outbound is only accepted when `security` is empty or `none`, so a REALITY outbound is skipped rather than dialled. `run` opens TCP and drops it. |
| 2 | VLESS TCP TLS (Vision optional) | `vless-tcp-tls` | **both roles, raw + ws + httpUpgrade + gRPC + xhttp + http header** | [reality-tls](docs/function/reality-tls.md) | Serves `streamSettings.tlsSettings.certificates[0].{certificateFile,keyFile}` through rustls (`proxy.rs:991`, `proxy.rs:1443`), PEM in PKCS8/SEC1/PKCS1 (`tls/mod.rs:94`), Vision optional on `flow`. The client dials `security: tls` outside the carrier through rustls (`proxy.rs:3051`, `proxy.rs:3262`); `allowInsecure`, mux and quic/kcp/hysteria rows are refused, and vision over TLS stays planned. |
| 3 | VLESS TCP none, private/loopback only | `vless-tcp-none` | implemented | [vless](docs/function/vless.md) | Both roles, TCP + UDP both directions, plus Mux: client `proxy.rs:1555`, server `proxy.rs:538`. Reachable only for hosts that fail `is_public_host` (`transport.rs:280`) — that check is the gate, not a heuristic. |
| 4 | VLESS/TROJAN `security=none` to public (PattNG ext.) | unsafe opt-in — *"security=none to a public address (`PattNG` extension): explicit opt-in required"* | refused | — | `Support::UnsafeRequiresOptIn`, `check` exits 3. The flag type exists (`policy.rs:17`, `UnsafeOptIn::allow_plaintext_to_public`) and nothing constructs it yet: the gate is parse-level only, so it has never been exercised with consent. |
| 5 | TROJAN TCP | *no `trojan://` link parser* | implemented, raw + TLS over every dialled carrier | [trojan](docs/function/trojan.md) | Both roles over raw + ws + httpUpgrade + gRPC + xhttp + http header, TCP and UDP (`proxy.rs:2283`, `proxy.rs:2074`). `security: tls` dials outside the carrier (`proxy.rs:3359`); quic/kcp/hysteria rows that ask for TLS are refused rather than sent plain. UDP is raw-carrier only. |
| 6 | VMess TCP (AEAD) | — (config-driven) | implemented, raw + TLS over every dialled carrier | [vmess](docs/function/vmess.md) | Both roles; ciphers `aes-128-gcm` → AES-GCM, `chacha20-ietf-poly1305`/`chacha20-poly1305` → ChaCha, `none`/unknown → Auto = ChaCha (`vmess.rs:19`). `security: tls` dials outside the carrier (`proxy.rs:3442`); any other security is refused rather than sent plain. UDP both roles, **raw carrier only** (`proxy.rs:1643` refuses anything else). Carriers implemented for VMess too: raw, ws, xhttp, http header, httpUpgrade, gRPC (`vmess.rs:1091`–`1185`). |
| 7 | Shadowsocks TCP/UDP | — (config-driven) | implemented | [shadowsocks](docs/function/shadowsocks.md) | `aes-128-gcm`, `aes-256-gcm`, `chacha20-ietf-poly1305`, `xchacha20-ietf-poly1305` plus the Xray spellings (`shadowsocks.rs:17`); key length 16/32. **MD5 chain only** (`MasterKey::new`, `shadowsocks.rs:183`) — `2022-blake3-aes-128-gcm`, `2022-blake3-aes-256-gcm`, `2022-blake3-chacha20-poly1305` and rc4-md5 are rejected by name. UDP both roles, raw carrier only, per-datagram salt. |
| 8 | VLESS over ws | `vless-ws`, `vless-ws-tls` | implemented | [carrier-websocket](docs/function/carrier-websocket.md) | Both roles; TLS and REALITY sit outside the carrier on both roles, the way the references order it. |
| 9 | VLESS over xhttp | `vless-xhttp`, `vless-xhttp-tls` | implemented, one mode | [carrier-xhttp](docs/function/carrier-xhttp.md) | Both roles. One mode only: POST plus `Transfer-Encoding: chunked` (`xhttp.rs:264`) — padding and placement rules per mode are not implemented. A slice in `prompts.md` still says this carrier has no implementation; that line is stale. |
| 10 | VLESS over gRPC | `vless-grpc`, `vless-grpc-tls` | implemented | [carrier-grpc](docs/function/carrier-grpc.md) | Both roles, full HTTP/2 + HPACK, `T_DATA`/`T_HEADERS`/`T_SETTINGS` (`grpc.rs`, 1292 lines). Path built as `/<service>/Tun`, default `/Tun` (`proxy.rs:4175`). |
| 11 | VLESS over httpUpgrade | `vless-httpupgrade`, `vless-httpupgrade-tls` | implemented | [carrier-httpupgrade](docs/function/carrier-httpupgrade.md) | Both roles (`proxy.rs:1502`, `proxy.rs:462`). |
| 12 | VLESS http masquerade / header | `vless-tcp` | implemented | [carrier-httpheader](docs/function/carrier-httpheader.md) | Both roles (`proxy.rs:1541`, `proxy.rs:516`); selected by `tcpSettings.header.type == "http"` (`proxy.rs:4206`). |
| 13 | VLESS over QUIC | `vless-quic` | client only | [carrier-quic](docs/function/carrier-quic.md) | Dial + pool, one handshake per server (`quic.rs:591`, `quic.rs:671`), quiche with ALPN `h3`, roots required from `caCertFile` — without them the dial returns `None` (`quic.rs:206`). The **server role is refused** (`refused_carriers!`, `proxy.rs:534`). Reached only from a SOCKS inbound without Mux. |
| 14 | KCP / mKCP | `vless-kcp` | implemented, TCP only | [kcp](docs/function/kcp.md) | Both roles for VLESS, VMess, Trojan and Shadowsocks over plaintext KCP, plus VLESS over KCP under TLS and REALITY (`proxy.rs` `serve_*_kcp`/`dial_*_kcp`); `kcpSettings` (`mtu`, `tti`, capacities, multiplier, window, both casings) parsed into `kcp::Config` (`proxy.rs` `kcp_config`). The core rung stays oracle-proven against pinned Go `xray-core/transport/internet/kcp` (`kcp/oracle.rs`). UDP and Mux stay raw-carrier-only tree-wide, so they refuse KCP like every other carrier. |
| 15 | `?ed=N` early data, ws | — | implemented, both roles | [carrier-websocket](docs/function/carrier-websocket.md) | One parse for both roles (`transport::EarlyData`), one allocation per encode; client adds the `Sec-WebSocket-Protocol` line (`ws.rs:435`), server decodes and replays it (`ws.rs:384`). |
| 16 | `?ed=N` early data, httpUpgrade | — | parsed, **not carried** | [carrier-httpupgrade](docs/function/carrier-httpupgrade.md) | `?ed=N` is stripped from the path (`proxy.rs:4146`) and the budget is a path-level test only (`httpupgrade.rs:109`); nothing sends or decodes early data on this carrier. The earlier README's "both roles" was true for ws only. |
| 17 | `cipherSuites` (PattNG ext.) | — | **not parsed** | — | Never read anywhere in `crates/`; survives only as an opaque entry of `VlessLink.params`. Parsed-but-carried was the claim; carried is not true. |
| 18 | `unsafe-*` fingerprints (PattNG ext.) | unsafe opt-in — *"unsafe fingerprint requested: re-run with explicit opt-in"* | refused | [reality-tls](docs/function/reality-tls.md) | `fp` starting `unsafe-`, or `allowUnsafeFp=1` (`vless.rs:90`). There is no uTLS or ClientHello shaping in this tree at all, so nothing would be spoofed even if consent were given. |
| 19 | Hysteria v2 | `vless-hysteria` | implemented, TCP only | [carrier-hysteria](docs/function/carrier-hysteria.md) | Both roles over quiche, ALPN `h3` (`hysteria.rs`, `proxy.rs` serve/dial arms); `hysteriaSettings` (`auth`, `congestion`, `version`) parsed with guarded fallbacks, non-v2 refused as `Unknown`. Wrong password refused with `404` then close, nothing relayed. The `protocol: hysteria` inbound serves the proxy shape itself — the request names its destination, the server acknowledges before it dials — proven against the pinned xray-rust Hysteria v2 client by the `xray-rust-hysteria` row in `conformance.yml`. UDP flows, salamander obfuscation and the masquerade site are not carried. One handshake per flow (no pooling). |
| 20 | MASQUE CONNECT-IP (RFC 9484) | planned — *"parses, dial needs a QUIC stack"* | refused | [carrier-quic](docs/function/carrier-quic.md) | Name only: `TransportKind::Masque`, `Carrier::Masque`. quiche is pinned as the default stack for this rung when it lands. |
| 21 | TUIC / AnyTLS / ShadowTLS / Snell / Naive / SSH / OpenConnect / OpenVPN | parse to `TransportKind::Other` — *"unknown type: parses, transport not scheduled"* | refused | — | Zero occurrences in `crates/`. They are refused by falling into `Other`, not by a hand-written list, so there is no per-protocol reason string to quote for them. |
| 22 | Mux / XUDP / `multi` | — | implemented, **raw carrier only** | [mux-cool](docs/function/mux-cool.md) | The codec is complete — `Status`/`Network`/`Target`/`Outgoing`/`Incoming`, `global_id`, `CHUNK_MAX` (`mux.rs`) — and it is wired in both roles when `mux.enabled` is true. XUDP rides the mux: a `Network::Udp` target opens a UDP socket keyed by the frame's `global_id`, datagrams arrive as `Keep` frames carrying their own destination, and replies return as `Keep` frames carrying their source. The client sends one XUDP session per SOCKS association instead of dialling a carrier per destination. Both roles encode the mux request the way upstream does — command 3, no address (`vless_mux_header`) — so a real Xray peer agrees on the wire; `KeepAlive` is a no-op and the cap is `DEFAULT_CAP` 8 sessions. |
| 23 | HTTP proxy, both roles | inbound implemented, outbound planned | sing-box `protocol/http/` in+out. The `http`/`mixed` inbound serves CONNECT to every outbound and origin-form to raw uplinks (`serve_http`, `proxy.rs`), proven by loopback and by the `foxy-relay.yml` http-front legs. No HTTP-proxy upstream outbound exists yet, so a chain that starts `https-proxy → …` is refused with the reason. |
| 24 | dokodemo-door transparent inbound | — (config-driven) | refused | — | Planned. Xray `proxy/dokodemo/`, TCP+UDP. Zero occurrences in `crates/`. |
| 25 | blackhole sink outbound | — (config-driven) | refused | — | Planned. Xray `proxy/blackhole/`; sing-box `protocol/block/`. The only sink-shaped outbound in tree is `Freedom` (`proxy.rs:247`). |
| 26 | DNS outbound | — (config-driven) | refused | — | Planned. Xray `proxy/dns/` + `app/dns/` (UDP/TCP/DoH/QUIC/FakeDNS); sing-box `protocol/dns/`; ZeroNet `zero-dns` (UDP/TCP/DoT/DoH/DoH2/DoH3/DoQ). No `dns` protocol in `proxy.rs`. |
| 27 | loopback re-inject inbound | — (config-driven) | refused | — | Planned. Xray `proxy/loopback/`. `loopback` in tree means loopback test sockets only. |
| 28 | Shadowsocks-2022 ciphers | — (config-driven) | refused by name (row 7) | [shadowsocks](docs/function/shadowsocks.md) | Planned. Xray `proxy/shadowsocks_2022/`; ZeroNet `shadowsocks2022.rs` (`2022-blake3-*`, TCP-only like ours). |
| 29 | TUN inbound (native) | — (config-driven) | refused by name | [a_device_inbound_is_refused_by_name_rather_than_served](crates/ferrox-app/src/proxy.rs) | Planned. Xray `proxy/tun/`; sing-box `protocol/tun/` + `transport/device/`; ZeroNet `zero-tun`. Row 58 is the tun2socks translator; this row is the native inbound. A device needs a platform device (`utun`/`tun`/Wintun), a userspace IP stack and root or an entitlement, none of which this binary has, so a config naming one is refused and serves nothing — the served surface stays the fronts, and `foxy-macos.sh --vpn` is the documented system-proxy mode. |
| 30 | Unix domain sockets | — (config-driven) | refused | — | Planned. Xray `transport/internet/system_listener.go:46-75` Unix wrappers. Tree binds TCP only (`unix` hits are `UNIX_EPOCH` clocks). |
| 31 | finalmask post-TLS mask chain | — (config-driven) | refused | — | Planned. Xray `transport/internet/finalmask/` (`fragment`/`noise`/`salamander`/`realm`/…). Zero occurrences in `crates/`. |
| 32 | xdrive cloud-drive carrier | — (config-driven) | refused | — | Name only: `TransportKind::Xdrive`, `Carrier::Xdrive` (`refused_carriers!`, `proxy.rs:284`). Xray `transport/internet/xdrive/` polls Drive remotes. |
| 33 | native HTTP/H2/H3 transport | — (config-driven) | refused | — | `TransportKind::Http` parses (`transport.rs:47`), never dialled (`is_dialled`, `transport.rs:56`). Even Xray refuses these now — `transport_internet.go` maps `h2`/`h3`/`http` to a removed-feature error pointing at XHTTP. |
| 34 | VLESS `encryption=mlkem768x25519plus` | — | refused | — | Planned. ZeroNet `vless_encryption.rs` (`native`/`xorpub`/`random` x `1rtt`/`0rtt`); LxBox passes it through (task 335); sing-box-lx SPEC 032. The tree's only ML-KEM is the REALITY hybrid key-share group (`reality.rs:10`). |
| 35 | `flow=xtls-rprx-vision-udp443` | — | refused | — | Planned. Xray accepts it outbound (`infra/conf/vless.go:329-334`); the tree knows only `xtls-rprx-vision`. |
| 36 | REALITY client | planned — *"server rung landed, client unwired"* | refused | — | Server role complete (row 1); an outbound is accepted only with empty/`none` security (`proxy.rs:4262`). ZeroNet `reality.rs` (`reality_connect`) is the second implementation to read. |
| 37 | TLS client from config | `vless-tcp-tls` + carriers | implemented for vless/vmess/trojan over raw, ws, httpUpgrade, gRPC, xhttp and http header | — | One session dials TCP, handshakes, then runs the carrier and the protocol header inside it (`proxy.rs:3051`); roots come from `caCertFile` or the system store, `allowInsecure` refuses. Xray `tls.go` and sing-box `common/tls/` are the shapes it was read against. |
| 38 | uTLS fingerprints | — | refused | — | Nothing shapes a ClientHello (row 18; bench emits the `utls` object, `linkconfig.rs:235`, shaping none). Xray `tls.go:204-277` preset/modern/other prints; sing-box `common/tls/utls_client.go`. |
| 39 | ECH | — | refused | — | Planned. Xray `ech.go` + `config.proto:80-86`; sing-box `common/tls/ech.go`; LxBox passes `tls.ech{}` through from JSON. Zero word-hits in `crates/`. |

### B — PattNG in full (what the fork wires)

### C — VPN / tunnel carriers

| 49 | Multipath QUIC (`draft-ietf-quic-multipath`) | planned | mqvpn, slipstream, quiche |
| 50 | quiche itself: QUIC + HTTP/3, 0-RTT, migration, key updates, batched datagram I/O | provider, not a lane — in use for row 13 | quiche pin |
| 51 | Multipath schedulers `minrtt` / `wlb` / `wlb_udp_pin` / `backup-fec` | planned | mqvpn |
| 52 | Hybrid TCP lane (local termination over an H3 stream) | planned | mqvpn |

| 54 | Nested WireGuard (`gool`, two hops) | planned | Aether |

| 56 | TCP-over-DNS covert channel (base32 domain + TXT) | planned | slipstream |
| 57 | Multi-resolver parallel + port-53 impersonation, DCUBIC/BBR | planned | slipstream |
| 58 | tun2socks engine (TUN → TCP/UDP/ICMP; `userspace`/`hybrid`/`system`) | planned — zeptun, one device away from row 3; the name alone refuses a config, same as row 29 | zeptun |

### D — DNS-tunnel ways (learned from CottenDNS / MasterDnsVPN, not pinned)

Custom ARQ, ~5–7 B header overhead, session multiplexing, compatibility kept across the MasterDNS/StormDNS/CottenDNS lineage (MIT).

| # | method | state | learned from |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 59 | DNS carriers UDP/53 + TCP/53 + DoT/853 + DoH/443, per-resolver `auto`/`udp`/`tcp`/`dot`/`doh` + per-path override | planned | CottenDNS |
| 60 | Record-type rotation + QNAME reshaping + ID/cookie randomization | planned | CottenDNS |
| 61 | Reliability: ARQ + ACK/NACK, adaptive duplication, Reed-Solomon FEC, MTU discovery, ZSTD/LZ4/ZLIB, request packing | planned | CottenDNS, MasterDnsVPN |
| 62 | Balancing across resolvers: round-robin / least-loss / lowest-latency / hybrid + health checks, failover | planned | CottenDNS, MasterDnsVPN |
| 63 | Local DNS service + cache + DNS-over-SOCKS5 + hijack guards; SOCKS4/5 with auth; CIDR resolver lists | planned | CottenDNS, MasterDnsVPN |
| 64 | Server egress direct / upstream-SOCKS5 chaining + flood protection | planned | CottenDNS, MasterDnsVPN |
| 65 | Encryption methods 0–5 (none / XOR / ChaCha20 / AES-128/192/256-GCM) + auto-detect | planned | CottenDNS |

### E — circumvention engines (learned from mlmvpn_android, not pinned)

| # | method | state | learned from |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 66 | SoftEther / L2TP + WireGuard via `kittoku`; VPN Gate public relays | planned | mlmvpn |
| 67 | GST / EDG relay engines; GitHub Tunnel + Quick Connect pool; OpenVPN with TunnelBear | planned | mlmvpn |
| 68 | MLM Adaptive Engine: per-app route learning on one Xray tunnel + 5-step repair ladder | planned | mlmvpn |
| 69 | Config Studio + Config Arena: one Cloudflare Worker panel raced across panels on a clean IP | planned | mlmvpn |
| 70 | Game Booster: DNS/latency racing + pass-through DNS-only VPN | planned | mlmvpn |
| 71 | Sanction-domain smart routing | planned | mlmvpn |
| 72 | Server-less domain fronting (on-device CA, local TLS termination, re-establish under unblocked SNI) | planned | mlmvpn |
| 73 | Serverless / mihomo / superdns / pdoq / openvpn / http-injector / tunnel-wg / oblivion / auto lanes | planned | configer |
| 74 | Three-tier Emergency fallback | planned | mlmvpn |

### F — configer `https-proxy` + `foxy` lanes (learned, not pinned)

| # | method | state | learned from |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 75 | Free HTTPS-proxy lane: anonymous `POST /v3/launch/` mints a token, server list yields HTTPS proxies exported as `http://` URIs + Clash/sing-box profiles | planned | configer |
| 76 | Foxy lane: CONNECT to an account's edge over HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2 or HTTP/3, country-pinned at dial, per-flow Bearer, failover inside the country, SPKI pins, split-tunnel | in tree, every carrier socket-proven over a real QUIC, TCP and TLS connection (`cargo test -p ferrox-app foxy`): the FxA login with its two-factor branch, the Hawk-signed exchange, the Fastly `/_fs-ch-` bot challenge, the Guardian mint with its activate-and-retry, and the published Remote Settings catalogue that turns a `country` in a `foxy://` link into an edge. `auto` tries QUIC, then HTTP/2, then HTTP/1.1, and a refused pass latches. Against the live account the catalogue answers with `*.fastly-masque.net:2499`, and all three carriers reach it: `foxy-relay.yml` downloads 1 MB per carrier (h1, h2, h3, auto) with the exit country pinned, on ubuntu and windows; UDP datagrams ride CONNECT-UDP over HTTP/3 and then HTTP/2, whatever the TCP carrier is (`P43`, and the HTTP/3 form `foxy::loopback::the_masque_carrier_opens_connect_udp_over_quic_and_echoes_a_datagram` over a loopback quiche edge). `foxy-live.yml` reports the sign-in, the minted pass and the edge's carriers on a weekly schedule | configer, FoxyVPN |

### G — chaining: lanes stack, not just single dials

Today exactly one method dials per hop. The engine to build stacks them as an ordered list of hops, each hop dialling through the previous hop's local SOCKS / HTTP CONNECT / TUN front. (The 8-hop cap and `global_id` reuse in `mux.rs` are the pieces this reuses.)

- `foxy` first, then a `vless://`: the VLESS dial goes through the Foxy H2 CONNECT tunnel, so the VLESS server sees the Foxy exit — the shape of Aether `--mim`/`--gool`, PattNG `PROXYCHAIN` ordering and Aether `--upstream`, generalized to every lane above.
- Rules taken from the references: the control plane stays DIRECT unless a hop explicitly chains; each hop names its own upstream; at most one core-needing member per chain; every hop verifies its own exit; teardown runs before redial; headless runs take the first attempt and log the reasoning.
- Anything chains with anything: `https-proxy` → `vless`, `foxy` → `trojan`, `tor` → `masque-h2` (Tor carries TCP only, so the upper hop must be a TCP carrier), `dns-tunnel` → `shadowsocks`. A chain needing a capability its carrier lacks is refused with the reason, never silently downgraded.

### H — arti (Tor) + onionmasq

- `arti`: Aether carries it (`tor` feature) for `--tor`, `--tor-reverse` (MASQUE-H2 only, since Tor carries TCP only) and `--tor-only`, with bridges from bridgedb and `lyrebird` transports. Ferrox would support the same three shapes plus configer's Tor-lane synthesis (`torrc` rendering, bridge lines, `ClientTransportPlugin`, entry/exit pinning, control port, SNI verdicts). Planned; nothing in this tree.
- `onionmasq` (MIT/Apache-2.0): the experimental TUN interface for Arti — userspace TCP/UDP over Tor on an `onion0` device with its own DNS resolver, the piece `oniux` uses for per-app namespace isolation. Planned as the Tor-family TUN lane with binary-level exit-country pinning.

### I — SNI spoofing without root (learned, not pinned)

| # | method | state | learned from |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 77 | Fake-ClientHello SNI spoofing (DPI allowlist bypass, no root) | planned — nothing in CI checks it | `UAC-SNI-Spoofer-Android`; `sni-spoofing-rust` |

`VpnService` TUN intercepts device traffic and a userspace TCP stack owns the connection, so no `SOCK_RAW` is ever opened. The stack sends a fake ClientHello with a spoofed SNI and a deliberately wrong sequence number first: DPI sees the allowlist entry and permits the flow, the real server discards the bad-seq packet, and the legitimate handshake proceeds.

One day every box above is checked: a row keeps `planned` until its differential proof and its benchmark gate are green, exactly as rows 1–16 in table A already are — with the two gaps in that table named in place rather than rounded off.

### J — engine: routing, balancing, DNS, management (xray-core `app/`)

The config surface no link exercises: what sits around the protocols in a drop-in.

| # | method | state | supported today by |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 78 | Routing rules + geosite/geoip | planned | Xray `app/router/` + `app/geodata/`; sing-box `route/`; ZeroNet `zero-router`. No routing engine in `proxy.rs`: inbounds bind fixed ports, outbounds pick by protocol only. |
| 79 | Balancers: leastPing/leastLoad/roundRobin/random + urltest/selector | planned | Xray `router/balancing.go` + `app/observatory/`; sing-box `protocol/group/`; ZeroNet `zero-observatory` ladder; LxBox round-robin urltest (task 208). |
| 80 | Built-in DNS app (UDP/TCP/DoT/DoH/DoQ/FakeDNS/cache) | planned | Xray `app/dns/`; sing-box `dns/`; ZeroNet `zero-dns` + `dns_oracle` tests. Row 26 is the outbound; this row is the resolver. |
| 81 | Reverse tunnel bridge/portal | planned | Xray `app/reverse/`. |
| 82 | Commander gRPC management API | planned | Xray `app/commander/`. |
| 83 | Connection-planner ladder (ordered rungs, climb on failure, earned descent) | planned | ZeroNet `zero-observatory` (10-rung `ALL`: DirectReality through AmneziaWireguard, 3 access classes). |
| 84 | Subnet scanner + server discovery | planned | ZeroNet `zero-scanner`, `zero-discovery` (feeds, link sort/probe, `warp.rs` account creation). |

### K — sing-box-only protocols and transports

What Xray has no equivalent of. Row H already covers Tor as a lane; the Hysteria2 carrier is row 19 — row 100 is only its missing options.

| # | method | state | supported today by |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 85 | mixed (HTTP + SOCKS) inbound | implemented | sing-box `protocol/mixed/`. `http` serves CONNECT to every outbound and origin-form to raw uplinks (`serve_http`, `proxy.rs`); `mixed` sniffs one byte (`serve_mixed`). Plain HTTP through a protocol outbound is 405 until P28's shared buffer carries prefixes. Proven by loopback (`http_connect_*`, `http_get_*`, `mixed_serves_*`) and by the `foxy-relay.yml` http-front legs downloading 1 MB live. |
| 86 | redirect + tproxy inbounds | planned | sing-box `protocol/redirect/`. Zero `tproxy`/`redirect` in `crates/`. |
| 87 | NaïveProxy | planned | sing-box `protocol/naive/`; LxBox imports `naive+https://` (task 037F). Zero `naive` in `crates/`. |
| 88 | AnyTLS | planned | sing-box `protocol/anytls/`; ZeroNet `anytls.rs`; LxBox imports `anytls://` (task 269). Row 21 is the link-type parse; this row is the auth + handshake. |
| 89 | ShadowTLS | planned | sing-box `protocol/shadowtls/`. Zero `shadowtls` in `crates/`. |
| 90 | Snell | planned | sing-box `protocol/snell/`. Zero `snell` in `crates/`. |
| 91 | SSH outbound | planned | sing-box `protocol/ssh/`; LxBox imports `ssh://` (§6). Zero `ssh` in `crates/`. |
| 92 | TUIC v5 over QUIC | planned | sing-box `protocol/tuic/`; ZeroNet `tuic.rs` + `quic_pool.rs`; LxBox imports `tuic://` (§9.5). Zero `tuic` in `crates/`. |
| 93 | Tailscale endpoint (tsnet, MagicDNS, exit nodes) | planned | sing-box `protocol/tailscale/`; LxBox feature 030 (preset 945, NETWORKS tab). Zero `tailscale` in `crates/`. |
| 94 | OpenConnect / OpenVPN endpoints | planned | sing-box `protocol/openconnect/`, `protocol/openvpn/` (each with `dns_transport.go`); LxBox passes `openvpn-client` through, no `.ovpn` (task 584F). |
| 95 | cloudflared (Argo) inbound | planned | sing-box `protocol/cloudflare/`. |
| 96 | Plain H2 + gRPC-lite transports | planned | sing-box `transport/v2rayhttp/`, `transport/v2raygrpclite/`. Tree has full gRPC only (row 10). |
| 97 | simple-obfs (http/tls) | planned | sing-box `transport/simple-obfs/`. |
| 98 | SIP003 plugin manager (obfs/v2ray-plugin) | planned | sing-box `transport/sip003/`. LxBox imports `plugin`/`plugin_opts` (§4) — carried nowhere yet. |
| 99 | Mux variants smux/yamux/h2mux | planned | sing-box `common/mux/` + `option/multiplex.go`. Tree has mux-cool only (row 22). |
| 100 | Hysteria2 salamander obfuscation + multiport | planned (salamander refused, row 19) | sing-box `protocol/hysteria2/`; LxBox §5 (`salamander`, `mport`/`server_ports`, gecko obfs). |

### L — ZeroNet + LxBox client-side superset

Reading copies for the lanes: WARP, Tailscale UX, detour shapes, DPI parameters, import formats, config building. Section G stays the chaining engine; row 104 names the reference shapes it must match.

| # | method | state | supported today by |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 101 | WARP: auto-race WireGuard vs MASQUE-H2/H3 + one-tap registration | planned | ZeroNet `warp.rs` + `warp/report.rs` (`WarpRoute::Auto`); LxBox feature 015 (on-device keys, `warp_endpoints.json`, SCAN generator). Row 45 is the carrier; this row is the account + race. |
| 102 | AmneziaWG 1.0–3.1 parameter set (junk/masquerade/header-protection/timings) | planned | LxBox §8.5 + tasks 097F/112/421; ZeroNet `amnezia.rs`; amneziawg-go + amnezia-client pins. Row 46 stays the one-line pointer. |
| 103 | Evasion on TCP/TLS (fragment, keepalive shaping, noise, fake-SNI) | planned | ZeroNet `zero-evasion/`; LxBox 016 (first-hop-only fragment, mixed-case SNI, REALITY pbk/sid validation). |
| 104 | Detour graph + hop chains with cycle detection | planned (G is the engine sketch) | LxBox feature 006 (`type:chain`, detour-as-direction, fail-closed, culprits named); Xray `dialerProxy`, sing-box `detour`. |
| 105 | Import superset: Xray JSON, sing-box JSON, WG INI, Amnezia `vpn://`, OpenVPN passthrough — with `.ovpn`, Clash YAML and hysteria-v1 as named gaps | planned | LxBox feature 002 + `PROTOCOLS.md` §§9–11 (gaps named in its Boundaries, not silently dropped). |
| 106 | VLESS `flow`/`encryption` grammar + XHTTP full params (modes, padding, placements, `xmux`) | planned | LxBox 016 (`xhttp-params.md`, task 127F); ZeroNet `xhttp.rs` + `xhttp_request.rs` (stream-one/stream-up/packet-up). Tree: one xhttp mode (row 9), one flow (row 35 is the gap). |
| 107 | Config template + contract registry (typed vars, schemas, build gate) | planned | LxBox features 024/025 (`build_config.dart`, `contract/registry/protocols/*.json`). |

### M — SlipNet tunnel types (learned from anonvector/SlipNet, not pinned)

Android VPN client (Kotlin + Go CLI) whose tunnel table is DNS-first: three KCP + Noise DNS transports, QUIC Slipstream, SSH everywhere as a chaining layer, NaiveProxy, a DNS-only DoH mode, and Tor — with a built-in DNS scanner. Searched this machine and this tree first: no local copy exists, nothing was pinned or cloned; the rows below are read off its README Tunnel Types + Features and its submodule list (`dnstt`, `dnstt-mobile`, `noizdns`, `vaydns`, `vaydns-mobile`, `lyrebird`, `meek-mobile`, `snowflake-mobile`).

| # | method | state | supported today by |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 108 | DNSTT (KCP + Noise DNS tunneling, the default) | planned | SlipNet (`dnstt`, `dnstt-mobile` submodules). Zero `dnstt` in `crates/`. |
| 109 | NoizDNS (DPI-resistant DNS tunneling, stealth mode) | planned | SlipNet (`noizdns` submodule). Zero `noizdns` in `crates/`. |
| 110 | VayDNS (configurable wire format: QNAME lengths, record types, rate limiting) | planned | SlipNet (`vaydns`, `vaydns-mobile` submodules). Zero `vaydns` in `crates/`. |
| 111 | `+ SSH` chaining over any tunnel (zero DNS leaks) | planned | SlipNet tunnel table (DNSTT/NoizDNS/VayDNS/Slipstream/NaiveProxy each ship a `+ SSH` variant). Standalone SSH is row 91; the Slipstream carrier is row 58 — chaining one through the other exists nowhere in tree. |
| 112 | SSH over TLS (custom SNI, domain fronting) / over ws-wss (CDN proxying) / over HTTP CONNECT (custom Host) | planned | SlipNet features. Zero `ssh` in `crates/`, so no SSH dialects either. |
| 113 | SSH payload injection (raw bytes before the handshake) + cipher selection (AES-128-GCM/ChaCha20/AES-128-CTR) | planned | SlipNet features. |
| 114 | DoH lane (DNS-only encryption per RFC 8484, no tunnel) | planned | SlipNet (`DOH` tunnel type). Row 80 is the resolver; this row is the DNS-only lane. |
| 115 | DNS server scanner (EDNS probing, NXDOMAIN-hijack detection, country-range scan) | planned | SlipNet (built-in DNS scanner). Row 84 scans subnets/proxies; this row scans resolvers. |

### Conformance, per row

The oracle names live in `upstream/pins.toml`, and `scripts/run-upstream-suite.sh` is the checker: it builds the named binary, refuses a pin whose rev does not read the seam it claims, injects the binary through that seam and rejects a green run that executed no test. Two pins are enabled — `zeronet` (8 named `xray_oracle` tests, seam `ZRAY_XRAY_BINARY`) and `xray-rust` (7 named `local_xray_interop_tests`, seam `XRAY_VLESS_FULL_BINARY`); the other eleven print `SKIPPED` with the rung that would enable them. Those suites are run in CI only.

Thirteen upstream pins, all resolving, all re-derivable by `scripts/fetch-upstream.sh`, all licence-clean for execution rather than copying:
`xray-core` (`7da5dae6`), `sing-box` (`fe92ab3e`), `amneziawg-go` (`b5928efb`),
`amnezia-client` (`3e9b70a5`), `xray-rust` (`f5aefca4`, `crates/`), `pattng` (`1ee7205c`, `V2rayNG/`),
`zeronet` (`97a99734`, `crates/`), `mqvpn` (`078845ce`), `aether` (`6175b67d`),
`zeptun` (`1bf81313`), `slipstream` (`397850b1`), `quiche` (`96e7dd51`, `quiche/`, `master`),
`lxbox` (`15e4fcb8`, `app/`).
Read but not pinned: `WhiteDNS/CottenDNS`, `masterking32/MasterDnsVPN`, `mlmvpn/mlmvpn_android`, `anonvector/SlipNet`, local `configer`.

## Adding a method, or changing one

A new connection method lands with its page, or the page and the code drift and
the checker says so. The page needs four numbers with a checker each, a
`graph TD` of the data path, and a `## Time` section that either cites a
workflow or says the number is not measured yet:

```bash
printf '%s %s %s %s\n' '<doc>' '<key>' '<value>' '<checker>' >> scripts/method-counts.txt
./scripts/check-method-docs.sh
```

`UNBLESSED` is the value this repository already uses for a count nobody has
measured: the named checker prints the real number on the next CI run and the
claim stays open until it has been read. It is not a number and must never be
quoted as one.

## Driving this with an agent

The roadmap is a file, `crates/ferrox-prompt/prompts.md`. Every slice carries a status, a leverage, an effort, the gates that would prove it finished, and the slices it blocks.

```bash
cargo run -p ferrox-prompt -- next        # the slice, the reason, prompt → clipboard
cargo run -p ferrox-prompt -- list        # the roadmap, with what is ready now
cargo run -p ferrox-prompt -- check       # is the library still coherent?
```

`next` refuses to hand over a slice whose inputs are unfilled, printing the exact `--set` command instead. Status is the only field to edit, and a slice is `done` when its gates are green, not when its diff looks finished.

Pinned checkouts under `upstream/` are for reading only: an agent starts every rung in the corresponding upstream implementation and ends in CI. A number produced off a named runner is not evidence about any runner.

## Contributing

```bash
./scripts/new-worktree.sh <name>      # isolated worktree: shared build cache, linked upstreams
./scripts/fetch-upstream.sh           # only what the links missed
cargo run -p ferrox-prompt -- next    # the slice
./scripts/check.sh                    # everything ci.yml runs, in seconds, before the push
```

Worktree first, so branches never share a working tree. Re-run the fetch whenever `upstream/pins.toml` changes under you. `check.sh` before every push is the whole friction policy: a lint found locally is free, a lint found in CI is a runner somebody else is waiting behind.

```bash
cargo run -p ferrox-bench -- --config 'vless://...'   # the comparison table for a link
cargo run -p ferrox-app -- check 'vless://...'       # parse offline; `run` dials TCP, sends nothing
```
